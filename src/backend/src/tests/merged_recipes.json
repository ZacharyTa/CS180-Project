    "Warm Duck Salad With Roasted Beetroot": {
        "Recipe Name": "Warm Duck Salad With Roasted Beetroot",
        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "Pre-heat the oven to 200 deg Celsius (400 F).\nStart by roasting the beetroots. Clean the beets of all mud and trim the stems. Wrap each beet tightly in aluminum foil. Place the wrapped beets on a pan and in a 200 deg Celsius oven for 30 to 40mins. They are done when they are very tender.\nWhile the beets are cooking, use a peeler and peel an orange, taking note to get as much of zest and as little of pith (the white parts) as possible. Stack the strips of orange zest and cut into fine strips with a sharp knife. Set aside.\nClean and dry the duck breasts. Score the skin of the duck. Make cuts into the fat layer and take care not to cut into the meat layer. Rub some salt into the skin side only of the duck. Add the duck breasts to a clean and COLD pan. Do not add any oil. Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium.\nAs the pan heats up, the fat from the duck will render off and the skin will brown beautifully. Always keep the heat to between medium to medium-high. Never use high heat as the skin will burn before the duck is cooked through. Once the skin is a gorgeous dark golden brown, flip the duck breasts to the other side and cook for a few more minutes till the other sides are also golden brown. Be careful not to overcook the duck. Set the cooked duck aside and leave to rest covered with foil. Duck, like beef must be rested. The resting time is half that of cooking time. If the duck was cooked for 6 mins, then it should be rested for at least 3 minutes.\nWhile the duck is resting, make the vinaigrette. Squeeze the juice of the zested orange into a bowl. About 5 to 6 tablespoons of juice. Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Use the best quality one you have. Add 4 teaspoons of balsamic vinegar. Add salt and pepper to taste. Whisk the mixture well. Set aside.\nWhen the beets are done, remove them from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes so that they are easier to hold. Put on some disposable gloves (else get blood red stained fingers later). Open the foil-wrapped beets. Using the rough surface of each piece of foil, rub the beets with the foil to remove the skin. Cut the cooked beets into small pieces. Set aside in a bowl.\nDrizzle 2 tablespoons of vinaigrette into the beets. Add 2 teaspoons of honey. Toss well to coat the beets with the dressing.\nSlice the rested duck into thin slices. The meat should be a beautiful pink.\nServe by layering the salad with greens, nuts and cheese of your choice, and the duck and beets.\nI like rocket greens with fresh basil or mint, mandarin orange segments, toasted almond flakes or pine nuts and some shaved parmesan cheese or some crumbed feta or goats cheese.\nGarnish with the orange zest.\nTrickle the vinaigrette over the salad.\nBest served immediately.",

        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "<p>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F. Poke your sweet potatoes with a fork and place them directly on the rack of your oven. Place a piece of foil on the rack below to reduce mess. Bake the sweet potatoes for 45-50 minutes or until tender. Times may vary depending on how hot your oven gets.Remove the potatoes from the oven and let stand at room temperature until they are cool enough to handle, about 20-30 minutes. Leave the oven on.While your potatoes are cooling, melt the butter over medium heat. Continue to cook the butter, stirring frequently, until brown bits begin to form on the bottom of the pan, about 5-6 minutes. Pay close attention as the butter can quickly go from brown to burnt in a matter of seconds. Once you see the brown bits forming and a nutty aroma fills the air, pull the butter from the heat immediately. Set aside.Cut the tops off of the sweet potatoes, lengthwise. Scoop the sweet potato flesh into a medium bowl, leaving the skins in tact. To the bowl, add the brown butter, 2 tablespoons of the fresh parsley, 3/4 of the chopped bacon, and 4 ounces of the goats cheese. Sprinkle with salt and black pepper to taste and mash the ingredients together until combined. Scoop the filling back into the sweet potatoes.Place the potatoes on a baking sheet that has been lined with foil or parchment paper. Place them back in the oven to bake for 25 minutes.While your potatoes are baking for a second time, prepare your avocado cream. In the bowl of your food processor or blender, combine the avocados, sour cream and buttermilk. Add a dash of salt and pepper and pulse until completely smooth and creamy.Once your potatoes have baked, remove from oven. Sprinkle on the remaining parsley, bacon and goats cheese. Drizzle with avocado cream and serve immediately.Enjoy!I hope you enjoy this recipe for brown butter twice baked sweet potatoes!</p>",

Once its combined and a sauce consistency, salt and pepper to your taste and pour into a separate bowl; cover.\nBring the heat back up to medium-high, and add another tablespoon of olive oil to the pan.  When hot add one tortilla at a time, turning after about 15-20 seconds to the other side.

Gently roll them around in the oil to brown all surfaces and ensure even cooking.</li><li>When the meatballs are a deep golden brown, remove them from the frying pan and set aside.</li><li>The tomatoes-onion mixture should have reduced to a sauce consistency now. You can use a hand blender to puree the mixture. Or leave the small bits of tomatoes and onions as they are.</li><li>Add the meatballs to the tomato sauce and let the meatballs warm through.</li><li>Garnish with more chopped parsley.</li></ol>",

Place beef on a cutting board and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving into thin slices (cut against the grain of the meat). Remove vegetables and arrange them on a serving platter. Cover with foil. Place the pot on the burner and bring sauce to a boil. Add cabbage and cook for about 7 minutes, until it has softened. Place the cabbage on the serving platter with the other vegetables.\nStrain the sauce in the pot and stir in 2 or 3 TBSP of spicy honey mustard until dissolved. Place in a small dish or gravy boat with a ladle and serve alongside the beef.\nAfter slicing the beef and arranging it on the serving platter, ladle the guinness mustard sauce over the top to rehydrate and glaze the beef and vegetables.",

        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "<ol><li>The place to start is with the tapioca, the pudding is a custard. So, in a heavy bottomed saucepan add the full milk, salt, tapioca, the seeds from the vanilla pod, and the empty vanilla pod. Bring this mix to a gentle simmer and stir occasionally. Do this until the tapioca is translucent and tender, this takes about 20 minutes. When cooked, stir in the coconut milk.</li><li>While the tapioca mix is cooking you can whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl - quite big as it has to hold half of your tapioca mix too. Mix the egg and sugar together until the color lightens.</li><li>Taking your cooked tapioca mix from the heat, pour half of it into the bowl with the eggs and sugar, whisk together using a metal hand whisk. Then pour this back into the pan and place on a medium heat.</li><li>On a medium heat keep whisking until the mix thickens, this takes about 5 minutes or so. It is important not to use too high a heat as the eggs will scramble. The mix will not become really thick, the chilling process with thicken it further. I like to check the sweetness level at this stage, you can add a little more sugar if you wish, but if you do, stir it through until it dissolves. Put your tapioca pudding in a clean, cool bowl, remove the vanilla bean and set aside to cool. When it has cooled, cover with cling film and put in the fridge.</li><li>Now for the pineapple. Combine the fruit with the honey, lime juice and most of the zest. Keep back a little lime zest to dress.</li><li>Place half of the mix in a food processor and blend until smooth. Transfer this back into the bowl with the rest of the pineapple and stir together  check the flavour and add more honey or lime if you wish.</li><li>Once your tapioca has chilled, place some of the pineapple mix in the bottom of your serving dishes, then add the tapioca and top with a little pineapple and some lime zest to finish.</li></ol>",

Roast in the oven for 8-10 minutes until the edges begin to show some color.  Remove from the oven and allow to cool.</li><li>While the peppers are roasting, prepare your stuffing.  Place the cream cheese, walnuts, garlic, salt, sriracha and black pepper in a bowl and mix until creamy (I used a fork to mash the ingredients together but Im sure this can be done in a food processor or mixer). Add the green onion and fold in to the cream cheese until combined.  Test the cream cheese for flavor. If you would like, add more salt and/or sriracha.</li><li>Heat your oven to 400 degrees. Use a spoon (or a piping bag) to stuff the peppers liberally and place them back on the baking sheet.  There is enough stuffing here to really pack those suckers up, so you dont need to worry about the amount of cream cheese youre portioning out.  If the cream cheese is very soft, place the baking sheet in the refrigerator for 15 minutes to allow it to set up. If not, place pop the peppers in the oven and bake about 8 minutes.  Change oven setting to high broil and bake an additional 2 minutes, until the tops of the cream cheese begin to brown (If theyre already brown at this point, skip the broiling).</li><li>Put on a pretty plate and serve to your friends.</li></ol>",

When fully incorporated, increase speed to medium and then to high, and whip until stiff-peaked.  Timing varies on this, and this is where practice makes perfect.  Add your food coloring gel when almost completely done whipping.</li><li>Sift 1/3 of the flour into the egg and fold in completely.  Repeat until all the flour is incorporated.  You want to fold in until the batter is smooth, but still light.</li><li>Spoon into pastry bag fitted with a large tip (I use between 1/2 and 1 inch, depending on what I grab first).  Pipe 1 inch rounds onto parchment lined baking sheets, pulling the tip to the side so as to not leave a peak mark.  I use very thick sheets for this recipe.  Double up if needed.</li><li>Tap the pan somewhat assertively on the counter to remove any trapped air and help batter to settle.</li><li>Let sit for 1/2  2 hours, until a shell forms on the top and your finger pressed lightly doesnt leave a mark.</li><li>Now, bakers are completely split on the right temperature for baking macarons.  Some bake slowly at 270-350 degrees.  I tried to keep my temperamental oven at around 300 for these, holding the door slightly ajar with a spoon.  This way I can keep them in longer to assure that the insides are cooked without browning them on top, which happened with a batch that was drier / baked higher.</li><li>Bake in fully preheated oven for 5 minutes, turn the pan, and bake for around 8 minutes more, or until the feet of the macaron are a bit sturdier than soft.</li><li>Cool on sheets for two minutes, then remove to rack to cool completely.</li><li>Fill with prepared lemon curd and refrigerate to harden. </li><li>Serve at room temperature with tea.

        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "<ol><li>Begin by preheating the oven to 120C. An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.</li><li>Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.</li><li>Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.</li><li>Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.</li><li>While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.</li><li>Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.</li><li>Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.</li><li>Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.</li><li>When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.</li><li>When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.</li><li>Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.</li><li>Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.</li><li>Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.</li><li>Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>Now make the sauce.</li><li>Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.</li><li>When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.</li><li>Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.</li><li>Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.</li><li>After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened. Remove the lemongrass.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check. Add more lemon juice if necessary. Whisk well to combine.</li><li>The salmon should be done by now. Remove them from the oven.</li><li>Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.</li><li>Gently place the salmon fillet on top. Drizzle a generous amount of sauce around the fish. Garnish with chives.</li></ol>",

    "Buckwheat Galette With An Egg": {
        "Recipe Name": "Buckwheat Galette With An Egg",
        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "Place all of the ingredients, save the last 2 eggs, in a blender and whisk until combined. Pour into a sealable container and set into the fridge overnight.\nIn the morning, take your batter out from the fridge and let it sit for about 30 minutes to an hour. Pour about a tablespoon of milk to it and stir around.\nPlace a crepe pan on the burner (over medium-high heat) and melt a pat of butter in it (you can use a silicone brush to coat the pan).\nPour 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and tilt it to swirl the batter around until it coats the pan. Your first crepe is always going to be experimental. The fresh butter might make it a little clumpy or bubbly and it might not cover the pan properly--don't worry, you'll get into the swing of things after 1-2 tries.\nCook for about one minute or so. Use a spatula to lift an edge--if it's slightly golden, it's time to flip. Once you flip, cook for another 45 seconds or so. The amount of time that you cook the galette depends on many factors: your stove, the type of pan you're using, how thick the batter is, etc. You might also need to adjust the temperature--my crepe pans work best on medium-high heat, but this might be too high for your stove and could burn the crepes. Start with medium heat and increase or decrease, depending on how long the crepes are cooking for. My best advice is to lightly lift the edge of the galette to see if it's starting to change color before flipping. The edges will usually be slightly crisped.\nI usually make about 2-3 galettes before using my silicone brush to add a little more butter to the pan. I like to use the brush because it guarantees even coverage and never creates big clumps of butter that cause the batter to curl in places. The galettes should peel off the pan easily.\nTo keep the galettes warm as you cook more, here's a trick: set a big pot of water on a nearby skillet. Top with a large plate and bring to a boil. Place the done galettes on the plate--the boiling water underneath keeps the plate warm.\nSo, considering this recipe makes about 10 galettes--that means two people could each eat 4 galettes on their own (or with a swipe of jam or Nutella and some berries on the side) and each have a galette topped with an egg.\nWhen you're done making all of the galettees, place one back onto your crepe pan. Carefully crack one egg into the center. Use a fork to sort of spread the egg whites around the entire galette (but be careful to not disturb the yolk!). Salt and pepper. At this time, you could also throw in some cheese--shaved Parmesan, or maybe some Gruyere. When the whites have thickened and are universally white, use a spatula to lift the sides of the crepes and gently fold over as you would an envelope, but leave a nice center hole for the yolk. Slide your spatula under and place on a plate.",

Combine all the filling ingredients well.\nThaw the dumpling wrappers if they are frozen. Keep them well covered until they are ready to be used.\nDust a dish generously with flour. This will hold the dumplings once they are made.\nDust the table generously with flour. Carefully separate the sheets of dumpling wrappers and lay them on the table. Fill each wrapper with about 1.5 teaspoons of the prepared pork filling.\nPrepare a bowl of water. Dip finger into the water and lightly wet the rim of each dumpling wrapper.\nBring the dumpling wrapper together till the opposite ends meet. Gently push the filling into the wrapper and pinch the top tip of the dumpling wrapper to seal it.\nFrom the centre of the dumpling, fold a pleat on ONE side and bring it to the other side of the dumpling. Fold towards the centre of the dumpling. Pinch to seal it.\nRepeat and create a 2nd pleat. Be mindful to pinch tight to seal the dumpling well. Repeat and create a 3rd pleat. Each side should have 3 pleats.\nRepeat the same pleating on the other end of the dumpling. Always ensure that the pleats face the centre of the dumpling.\nPlace all prepared dumplings in a well floured dish ensuring that they do not touch each other. Set aside till ready to cook. They can also be frozen at this stage.\nTo cook the potstickers, add 2 to 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil to a very hot frying pan. The potstickers should be cooked in at least 2 batches.\nWhen the oil is hot, add the dumplings ensuring that the flat surfaces face down. Pan fry till the bottoms of the dumplings are a nice golden brown.\nAdd 1/3 cup of water to the pan. Cover the pan immediately and let the steam cook the dumplings for 4 to 5 minutes.\nOnce the water has evaporated, remove the cover and let the dumplings sit in the hot pan for another minute for its base to crisp up again. These are now Chinese potstickers.\nGently transfer the potstickers to a plate. Serve immediately.\nThese Chinese potstickers are best served with a vinegar dip made with balsamic or black chinese vinegar and thinly sliced ginger. Soy sauce, chili oil or sesame oil may also be added to the dipping sauce.",

They'll finish cooking in the oven, later. After the 9 minutes, take them out and drain them face down on a paper towel. You don't want an excess water in the shell!\nWhile the noodles are cooking, work on your filling. Cook some frozen spinach in the microwave until it's no longer frozen. I'd recommend following the directions on the box, but don't add in any water. Once the spinach is cooked, add to the spinach, wheat germ, parmesan cheese, Mexican (the original recipe called for cheddar) shredded cheese, chopped pecans, and finely diced green onions. Mix until combined. Add in salt, a touch of pepper, and dried basil, to taste. I used about  teaspoon of dried basil, but feel free to use as much as you like. The sisters also suggest adding nutmeg, to taste, if you like!\nOnce the mixture is seasoned to your liking, add in two eggs and water and mix again until the eggs have been fully incorporated!\nNow stuff the mixture into each of the shells. You should have enough of the spinach filling to make about 16 - 20 shells. Set these aside.\nTake an 8 x 8 pan (you could also use a 9 x 13) and grease it with cooking spray. Now spread alfredo sauce on the bottom, you'll use about  of a jar. Spread spaghetti sauce on top of that. Use a spatula to spread it evenly on the bottom of the pan. Top the sauces with the shells. Use the remaining sauce to top the shells.\nBake in a preheated 350 degree oven, uncovered, for about 30 - 35 minutes or until the sauce is bubbly and serve!",

Bring to a simmer, reduce heat to a gentle simmer, and cook for 30 minutes more, stirring occasionally. Much of the liquid will cook down during this time.</li><li>Stir in all but 1/3 cup of black beans and cook 5 minutes more. Mash reserved beans with a fork, and stir into the chili to give it extra body. If chili is too thick, stir in as much as 1 cup additional broth and heat several minutes to warm. Chili can be prepared two days ahead. Cool, cover and refrigerate. Reheat over medium heat, stirring often.</li><li>Ladle into bowls and garnish with toppings. Enjoy!</li></ol>",

        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "Chop your onions, slice your carrots and smash your garlic. Set aside.\nPeel and chop the potatoes. Set aside in a bowl of cold water.\nRemove the casing from your chorizo. This is an important step. Chorizo casing is tough and unforgiving and will make the sausage link curl during the cooking process. Just remove it and don't worry about appearance. Cut the links length-wise then chop into half-moons. Sautee in a separate pan until the are nice and browned. Don't put into the pot until the last minute, otherwise the color of the chorizo will leach into the soup turning it a weird red color.\nNow it's time to prepare the kale. With each individual leaf, cut out the stem. You can do this several ways. Cut a triangle out of the leaf, or fold over the leaf and cut out the stem that way. Or rip off the halves of the leaves off the stem. I like a little bit of stem to give some crunch and texture.\nTightly roll the leaf into a bundle.\nRun your knife over it to julienne the leaf into thin strips.\nDon't worry if it's not perfect. Set aside the kale.\nIn a big pot, sautee your onions, carrots and garlic in a bit of olive oil.\nOnce the vegetables start to soften, add the potatoes and some crushed red pepper flakes. Stir the pot and cook the potatoes until the outer edges start turning clear.\nThen add the 6 cups of water and 2 bouillion packets (or 4 cups of broth and 2 cups of water) to the pot. Bring to a boil then let simmer until the potatoes are cooked.\nWith a wooden spoon, mash the potatoes against the side of the pot. Do this until almost all the chunks of potatoes are mashed. Leave some chunks behind. This will give your soup a wonderful hearty texture.\nNow it's time to add the Kale. It looks like a lot and will fill up your whole pot but not to worry because it wilts down pretty quickly.\nCook for 5 minutes at a simmer then stir in chorizo sausage. Serve hot or at room temperature (the latter is my favorite). Eat with a nice crusty loaf of Portuguese bread. Enjoy!",

Refrigerate anywhere from 3-10 hours.</li><li>After meat has finished marinating, remove steak from marinade and wipe off excess marinade with paper towel. (I also cut the steak into a couple of more manageable sized pieces, for easier turning on the grill). brush the vegetables with reserved marinade. Heat your grill to high. Scrape the grill grate clean and oil the grate. Add the steak to the super hot grill and grill, covered about 2 1/2 minutes per side (for medium/medium-rare), or until steak reaches desired doneness. Remove steak to a clean plate and cover with foil &amp; let rest for 10-15 minutes.</li><li>Add the peppers and onions to the grill and grill, turning occasionally until cooked, peppers should take about 5 minutes and onions will take about 10. Remove from grill. Briefly add the tortillas to the grill, a couple at a time and grill until warmed and lightly charred around the edges. Wrap the tortillas in foil to keep warm.</li><li>Thinly slice the steak, against the grain. Slice the onions in half and separate the rings. Slice the peppers. Serve with the tortillas, lime wedges and toppings of your choice.</li></ol>",

    "Beef Pot Pies with Irish Cheddar Crust": {
        "Recipe Name": "Beef Pot Pies with Irish Cheddar Crust",
        "Recipe Cooking Instructions": "Make the pastry: Place the cut up butter pieces in the freezer for 15 minutes to chill. Meanwhile, in the work bowl of a food processor combine flour, sugar, dry mustard, salt and cayenne pepper. Pulse to combine. After the butter has chilled, scatter the pieces over the flour mixture (still in the food processor), along with the cheddar. Pulse about 10 times. Sprinkle half the ice water over the dough, pulse about 3 times, repeat with remaining water, pulsing 3 more times. Pinch the dough to check if it sticks together, if not add a tablespoon or two more ice water, until it comes together. Dump the mix in a large bowl and press it together to form the dough. Divide dough in half, shaping each into a 4-inch disk. Wrap each piece in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least an hour.\nBegin the filling: Pat the meat dry with paper towels and season with salt & pepper. Heat 2 t. oil in a large skillet over medium high heat until just smoking. Add the meat in a single layer and cook, without stirring, until the meat browns well on the underside, anywhere between 5-10 minutes (the meat will give off liquid, just let it evaporate - leave it alone!) Stir the meat and cook another couple minutes, until it looses the raw color. Remove to a plate and set aside.\nReduce heat to medium, add the remaining 2 t. oil and the onions and carrots. Saute until softened and starting to brown, stirring occasionally, around 5 minutes. Add the garlic, thyme and marjoram, cook until very fragrant, about a minute. Stir in flour, cook and stir about a minute. Slowly add in the beef broth and water, then the meat, along with any juices left on the plate. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, to med-low. Cover and cook, (adjusting the heat as necessary to maintain a simmer) stirring occasionally until the meat is just becoming tender, around 45 minutes. Remove from heat, add in the Dijon and parsley. Adjust seasoning with salt & pepper. Set aside to cool.\nRolling out the crust, filling & baking the pot pies: Remove the dough from the refrigerator 10 minutes before rolling it out. Roll the dough out on a well-floured surface, large enough to cut out 3, 7-inch circles out of each half (save the scraps). Line each cup of a large-sized muffin tin with the dough. (It won't look very pretty, you just kind of have your way with it to get it pressed in there.) Refrigerate the filled tins as well as the dough scraps 15 minutes to firm back up.\nMeanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. After 15 minutes and the filling has cooled down quite a bit. Divide the mixture evenly between crusts. Divide the remaining dough into 6 balls. Roll out each piece wide enough to cover the pot pies. Pinch the top and bottom crust edges together to seal, and finish the edges in whatever decorative way you like. Brush the tops with the beaten egg. Bake 35-40 minutes, rotating the pan after 20 minutes. Remove from oven & let sit 5 minutes before (carefully) removing the pot pies from the tin.",

Set aside.\nWhen the dough is ready to be used, scatter some flour on the table or counter top. Knead the dough and gently form into a large block. Add more flour if dough is too sticky.\nThe dough should be a nice elastic block. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces. Set 3 pieces of dough aside. Cover with a slightly damp cloth to prevent them from drying out. Roll the 4th piece of dough into a nice ball.\nUsing a floured rolling pin, roll out that ball of dough into a flat circle. The dough should be thin, about 2 to 3mm thick. Cut the rolled dough into 8 pieces.\nPrepare some fruit preserves. I used a good jar of orange marmalade with pieces of orange rind in it.

Pour the cream mixture through a mesh strainer into the bowl.  Stir in the pumpkin and vanilla, add the cinnamon stick back to the mixture. Chill thoroughly, preferably overnight.\nPour the mixture into the freezer can of an electric ice cream maker and freeze according to the manufacturers instructions.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.\nIn the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the butter untill soft.  Add the sugar and continue beating until smooth and creamy.  Stop the mixer occassionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Stir in the vanilla, molasses and egg, combine thoroughly.  Mix in the dry ingredients gradually until the dough is smooth.\nTurn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and divide in half. Roll each half until its about 2 inches around, like a log.  Wrap each log in plastic wrap and then roll them lightly to smooth them out.  Refrigerate or freeze until firm.\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees and line two baking sheets with parchment.\nSlice the dough into 1/4 inch rounds with a serrated knift being careful to keep their shape. Place the rounds on the baking sheet and sprinkle with granulated or course sugar.\nBake for 10-13 minutes, rotating the pans halfway through the baking time.  Let the cookies cool in the pan for about 2 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack.\nDough can be refrigertaed for up to five days or frozen for up to three months.  Baked cookies can be stored in an air-tight container for approximately a week.\nTo assemble the sandwiches:\n(Im sure this is a no-brainer, but.you never know.)\nThaw the ice cream until soft enough to scoop.  Because of the high water content from the pumpkin puree it tends to freeze very firmly.\nTake one scoop of ice cream and place on top of one gingersnap, using a second cookie place on top of the ice cream and gently press down.",
